                <p class="text-muted text-left">The Marist Brothers International School Library is a literacy and research center serving the entire school community. We in the library strongly believe that the “best books” are the ones our patrons want to read, and to that end we actively take book/media requests and recommendations from students, teachers and parents and add them to our collection. We believe that a happy reader, supported by a dedicated library, is on the path to becoming an enthusiastic lifelong reader. <br>
At present, the library carries over 30,000 print and digital books, newspapers and magazines. Combined with our online subscription databases (including JSTOR, ProQuest Central Student, World Book Online, and CultureGrams), MBIS students have access to more than 12 million academic journal articles, books, and primary sources. Our library is a flexible learning space, supported by a class-size computer area, and every day you will find students studying independently, collaboratively, and virtually. The library staff is energized and ready to support and celebrate students’, teachers’ and parents’ love for reading. Whether it’s individually or in groups, we are dedicated to helping the entire school community with their reading and research needs. We celebrate the joy of reading with students from pre-K to Grade 12, and teach them information literacy and research skills during both regularly scheduled library class visits and teacher-scheduled class visits.
<br>
All of our online subscription databases can be accessed from school or home.  https://mbislibrary.follettdestiny.com/ </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">MBIS has a very proud athletic tradition.  Despite its relatively small size, the school has managed to acquire an impressive list of championships throughout the years.  We are also widely recognized for our sportsmanship and good character on and off the sporting fields and courts.  In the last two decades alone, MBIS has claimed over 200 championships and tournament trophies, within the local region and beyond, including overseas invitationals.
                    <br>
                    <br>
 
Our Middle School (grades 6-8) and Varsity (grades 9-12) programs offer opportunities to play five sports over four seasons: Volleyball, Soccer, Basketball, (Boys) Baseball and (Girls) Softball.  As members of the Western Japan Athletics Association (WJAA), we compete in regional leagues and tournaments against other international and US base schools, as well as occasionally coming up against teams from as far away as Tokyo and Hokkaido.  Students may also have the opportunity to compete in tours and tournaments abroad.   MBIS also hosts an annual Invitational Futsal Tournament for students in grades 3-6, competing against other international schools in the region.  
 <br>
                    <br>

Being a small school, all students can "make the team".  We believe that our athletic program is more than an opportunity to increase fitness and physical ability - students have frequent opportunities to develop skills  that will serve them well throughout their lives.  Dedication to sports means a dedication to practice, risk-taking, hard work, self-discipline, teamwork, fair play, leadership, and so much more.  
<br>
                    <br>
The MBIS athletic facilities include a full-size gym, well-stocked weight room, and a synthetic grass sports field.  Campus games and tournaments are organized by the very popular Marist Athletic Association (MAA), providing opportunities for students to work behind the scenes, as well as on the court.

Sports Day 2019

                    
                </h5>
                <p>On April 26, the MBIS community travelled to Oji Koen Stadium for its annual Sports Day. It is a day that unofficially marks the start of the ‘sunny season’, and this year continued that tradition, blessing us with a beautiful day for sport. It was also a day for record-breaking, with the following students entering the record books.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

A special congratulations to Gautham, Lisa, and Herard, for setting a pair of new records each. Herard’s 100m time is the equal-second fastest in our modern record books (Jeremy Smith holds top place, with time of 11.60 in 2008). Gautham now holds the top record for six events - so we have an exciting future athletic prospect coming up - well done, Gautham!

The highlight of Sports Day is always the final relays. This year did not disappoint, and, while no new records were set, each one was hotly contested. With Samurai claiming three of the six races, it seemed like they were about to reclaim their former glory and lift the trophy. However, a sudden afternoon downpour brought the day to a premature end - we would have to wait until assembly on the following Monday to find out which house had won. After the final points were tallied, top honors went to Ninja, their first victory since 2016 - congratulation to the boys and girls in black. The overall House Champions Trophy for 2018-2019 was claimed by Sohei.

MBIS Invitational Softball Tournament 2019
                    
                </h5>
                <p>The MBIS Varsity Girls Invitational Softball Tournament was held on May 19-20, and contested by four schools - MBIS, Osaka and Senri International School, Canadian Academy, and Nagoya International School. Although there was plenty of action on the field, the tournament also featured the debut of an updated MBIS livestream - complete with scoreboard, base tracking, and multiple camera angles (thank you to our hard-working IT crew for this wonderful new setup). On Sunday, the championship game was between MBIS and Canadian Academy. Although the MBIS team had bested CA in an earlier game, the visitors put on a gutsy performance, holding MBIS to 3-3 by the end of regular innings. It was a see-saw match-up, and one of the most exciting games in recent memory. During the extra innings, the MBIS girls surged ahead, adding 3 more runs to their total. CA added a run, but accurate pitching by Rei Hama made all the difference, giving the MBIS Varsity Girls their second championship trophy for the year. Well done, girls!</p>

After last year’s wonderful musical, the Wizard of Oz, we were all wondering what the team behind the performance was going to treat us with next.  The next production started in September, 2018, with Beauty and the Beast chosen.  According to Co-Director, Mr. Lynch, “Mr. Duck and I knew from last year’s performance that we had a group of talented students, so we wanted something that would challenge our case and excite our audiences - this was the perfect choice.
                    <br>
                    <br>

With that decided, the next major step was casting. Auditions were held in October - “We were both very impressed with the students who sang and acted for us.  Choosing students for each role was very challenging, but we eventually found the perfect role for each student and they continued to impress us throughout rehearsals.” 
<br>
                    <br>
Mr. Lynch was also very impressed with the students’ ability to deal with the challenges of acting - “I was very impressed at seeing students learning so many lines in English because for a lot of students in this school it is not their first language. In fact, some characters had lines to learn in nearly every scene! That requires a lot of dedication and practice.  After learning their lines the cast put lots of effort into acting techniques on stage, singing, dancing and creating a convincing character.”

Following the first performance, there was a lot of praise for this year’s costume and choreography.  The task of Costume Coordinator was very capably undertaken by Miss Buchanan, while Mrs. Duck took charge of choreography - “She worked very hard creating and teaching the students choreography in a way that was easy to follow,” said Mr. Lynch, “the students definitely had a lot of fun.”
<br>
                    <br>
Set design was led by Mrs. Carter, who dedicated a lot of time into customising both set and props.  She was aided by a talented and hard-working group of students from Grade 11, who also doubled up as stage hands during the performances.  They gave up many hour after school to assist, which was deeply appreciated and certainly helped bring the story to life on the stage,
<br>
                    <br>
The opening performance was on April 11 - “As the cast and I waited backstage, we could hear the excited chatter of the audience waiting for us to start” said Mr. Lynch, “The cast was very nervous, but ready to impress with their talent.  And they certainly did. Throughout the performance I was very impressed with the energy that every actor and actress put in, and how everyone on stage worked together to ensure everything was as convincing as possible.”
<br>
                    <br>
The final performance was held in the evening of April 13.  Although they had already impressed on the first day, the open-air, night-time performance under lights added something magical. 
<br>
                    <br>
How will they top it next year?  Mr. Lynch is already looking ahead - “For anyone who wants to get involved, I strongly encourage you to do so, as it is a very rewarding and, more importantly, a fun experience.  Auditions will be held after the summer - I hope to see many students there!”
